					I'm a React.js Developer. I have had the opportunity to teach

					developer and programming teacher has given me a deep appreciation for
					the intersection of technical skills, creativity, and design. I
					believe that these three elements are essential for creating truly
					great software, and I'm always excited to explore new ways to bring
					them together in my work.
